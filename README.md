		the game is in the alpha stage the actual game should be almost unplayable...
		But go ahead and see what I have created so far.
		I hope to make this game text based then start working on the appearance
		of the game later on... 
		If you are going to run this version of TXT_DUNGEON then run it in
		a java code runner... Like eclipse...
		Last edition of the game by this date is the menu.

		Fancy Game Title is added.
		ex:
		//_____ _    _ _____  ____    _   _    _    _  ______ _____ _     _ 
		//   |  |   |_|_|_|   |  |       |    _   \ |  |  |  | |   \  | | |             |          |   \  | | 
		//   |  |      |  |      |  |       |   |  |  | |  |  |  | |     \| | |      __   |___    |     \| | 
		//   |  |    _|_|_    |  |       |   |_|  | |  |_|  | | _/\_ | |          |  |          | _/\_ | 
		//   |_|   |_|  |_|    |_|      |____/  |____| |/      \| |_____| |_____||/      \|

		The game is still in the alpha stage and the actual game
		should still be almost unplayable...
		But go ahead and see what I have created so far.
		Though it is probably really buggy because I have not fixed many mistakes yet...
		I worked on some of the main titles making them a little more exciting hopefully:
		//_____ _    _ _____  ____    _   _    _    _  ______ _____ _     _ 
		//   |  |   |_|_|_|   |  |       |    _   \ |  |  |  | |   \  | | |             |          |   \  | | 
		//   |  |      |  |      |  |       |   |  |  | |  |  |  | |     \| | |      __   |___    |     \| | 
		//   |  |    _|_|_    |  |       |   |_|  | |  |_|  | | _/\_ | |          |  |          | _/\_ | 
		//   |_|   |_|  |_|    |_|      |____/  |____| |/      \| |_____| |_____||/      \|
		And
		// _       _  ____  _     _   _  _
		// |  \    /  |  |          |  \  |  |  | |  | |
		// |    \/    |  |__      |    \|  |  | |  | |
		// |          |  |          | _/\_ |  | |_| |
		// |          |  |____  |/      \|  |___|
		It is really hard to see in this form so if you want to see it 
		better paste the raw code into a document.
		Of course you should remove the "//"   
		If you are going to run this version of TXT_DUNGEON then
		run it in a java code runner... 
		Like eclipse...
		Last edition to the game by this date is finishing the menu
		Next additions to the menu are going to be secrets if you insert 
		certain phrases and random phrases or somethingâ€¦
